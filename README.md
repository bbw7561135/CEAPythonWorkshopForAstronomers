# CEA Saclay Python Workshop For Astronomers

Python is friendly, powerful open-source language that is becoming a
standard in astronomy and industry. Packages are available from simple
plotting to advanced tasks like numerics, machine learning, virtual
observatory access, and multi-processing allowing researchers to work
more efficiently.

The python astronomical community has been growing rapidly in the last
few years and is working to replace proprietary software like IDL and
Matlab. This benefits labs directly by reducing the need for expensive
licences.

The workshop will be a 2 day intensive hands on workshop (offered
twice) for astronomers who would like to use python in their research.
The workshop will contain an introduction for new comers to python and
will cover common tasks that are useful for astronomers. The lessons
will be interactive, with "breakout problems" to enhance learning. The
instructors are providing this workshop for the benefit of the
department and out of their own very busy schedules, so if you
register please expect to attend all sessions.

Target audience:

* students working with data (analysis, visualization, etc)
* IDL/Matlab/fortran users who want to move to a modern and free   environment
* Anyone who wants to use Python but never had the time and opportunity to learn
